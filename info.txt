git branch                  -> see local branches
git branch -a               -> see all branches

git checkout mitani         -> change branch to "mitani"
git checkout main           -> change branch to "main"

git merge my-branch         -> merges local branch "my-branch" to current branch (main)
git merge origin/my-branch  -> merges non-local branch "my-branch" to current branch (main)



stef  -> working on signals
stef2 -> working on is_valid


how to force merge:
	git fetch origin
	git reset --hard origin/main
	git push --force



TO DO;
.do execution
.nandle errors
.handle signals in working processes
should we handle "> outfile" (we will have to write input)
.

WHAT TO DO:
instead of returning 1 for invalid node due to invalid fiel, i put a error_type enum struct
which will say if every file is valid or invalid. this will be in list if im correct. 
i need to change new node's return to a t_list
